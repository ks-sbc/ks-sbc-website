# Welcome to the Kansas Socialist Book Club!
![[ks-sbc.png]]
This is the official website that represents the Kansas Socialist Book Club (KS-SBC). Formed in 2022, the KS-SBC served primarily as an online space to conduct political education about socialism in Kansas. It has grown from a small gang of about 10 people to over 170 people interested in the ideas of Communism and Socialism in the state of Kansas!

Our experiences told us purely studying online was not sufficient. Furthermore, we decided that our lessons and curriculum need to have a coherent ideology. You can see our [[bylaws#Points of Unity|Points of Unity]] to learn more about the specific ideology that we uphold. In a nutshell, we teach Decolonial Marxism that incorporates the theories of Comrade Vladimir Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong. ^a81563

The [[bylaws#Bylaws|structure]] of our organization has changed as well. Instead of being an informal group governed by vibes, we have coalesced around the model of a cadre-based Communist study group. To clarify: ***we are not a Communist Party. We are not a Pre-Party Formation. We are a book club that does political education.*** However, part of political education is going out into the community and conducting investigations. It also means organizing events. our purpose is education, but we define that very broadly.

If you want to attend a lesson, listed below is our contact information as well as our Discord server. Discord is the central communication hub where you will get the most frequent updates. You can also send us an e-mail at ks-sbc@proton.me if you prefer to correspond in that fashion.

Whatever the case, just know that ***you can always find us at the Library every Wednesday, at 6:30pm***. We make it a disciplined habit to show up every week, week after week. The only exception is the last week of every month, which is our [[minutes|Monthly Business Meeting]]. Those are usually conducted online later in the evening.
