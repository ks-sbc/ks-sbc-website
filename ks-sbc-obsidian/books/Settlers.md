- Description: In this controversial book Sakai's research picks up the story of White people's widespread refusal to work for the benefit of non-white people, which threads back to the earliest colonies in America (or "Amerika" as it's styled in the book). Sakai shows how the theft of native land and the fruits of slave labor set the material base for an upward wealth trajectory for generations of White settlers that undergirds the current exceptional-race myth. That myth continues to draw White US Americans into aligning with the ultra-wealthy, owner/landlord class around the world instead of non-White working people. Exploring themes of white chauvinism/supremacy and the labor aristocracy.
