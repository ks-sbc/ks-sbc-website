- Description: This book makes a compelling case that the United States is fascist. Jackson breaks down precisely what he means when he calls the US fascist. He also explains the pitfalls of electoralism, "working within the system", and draws on his own experiences as a Black Panther and urban guerilla soldier to explain to the reader why there is no solution but revolution.
