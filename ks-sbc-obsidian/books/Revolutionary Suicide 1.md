- Description: In the pages of Huey Newton's memoir comes a prescient tale of the realities face by Black America: even when they follow all the rules and try to support each other out of their oppressed position, white America will do everything in its power, illegal or not, to keep them down. And what Huey fought this with was simple: ideas of a world that was better than the one in which we are living.
