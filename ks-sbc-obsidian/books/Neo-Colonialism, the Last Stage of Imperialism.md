- Description: In this unofficial sequel to Vladimir Lenin's Imperialism Kwame Nkrumah defines the essence of neocolonialism as the condition where a state appears to be nominally independent, its economic and therefore its political system is controlled by outside forces, namely the western monopoly capital specifically. Nkrumah defines neocolonialism as the last, worst, most developed and desperate stage of imperialism.
