# Revolution

As Marxist-Leninists and Maoists, we believe in the necessity of a revolution. We furthermore understand that there is no alternative to the issues plaguing capitalism. Before we can even get into anything else, we have to firmly educate people in why this is the case. If we cannot agree on this simple fact, we're bound to go nowhere.
## Why Revolution is Necessary

Why is capitalism bad? Why is it unsustainable? Why does it cause so much misery? How does it exploit people? These are the questions we seek to answer in this module.

## Why There Is No Alternative

Okay, so Revolution sounds pretty great! But that's a lot of work and risky too. A lot of people have failed, what makes us any different? Why can't we just increase regulations? Why can't we reform away the worst aspects? These are the questions we seek to answer in this module.

## Successful Revolutions

It's always good to have real, historical examples of actual Communist revolutions which succeeded. Communism is not a pie-in-the-sky idea, nor is it a lofty and abstract idea. It is the real movement of the actually existing working class and it's triumph over the exploiters: the bourgeoisie. This module seeks to give examples of what revolutionary success looks like.

# How to Think Like a Communist
## Social Investigations & the Mass Line

> *To take such an attitude is to seek truth from facts. "Facts" are all the things that exist objectively, "truth" means their internal relations, that is, the laws governing them, and "to seek," means to study. We should proceed from the actual conditions inside and outside the country, the province, county or district, and derive from them, as our guide to action, laws that are inherent in them and not imaginary, that is, we should find the internal relations of the events occurring around us. And in order to do that we must rely not on subjective imagination, not on momentary enthusiasm, not on lifeless books, but on facts that exist objectively; we must appropriate the material in detail and, guided by the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, draw correct conclusions from it.*

It is important to study history and theory written by actual revolutionaries; of this, there is no doubt in our minds. However, those theories all cover different situations than the one we currently live in! Our own contemporary world requires its own contemporary theory. So how do we construct a theory? Do correct theories simply fall from the sky? Where do these correct ideas and theories come from? Why, they come from practice! What kind of practice, exactly? That would be the methods developed by Comrade Mao Zedong of *Social Investigations and Class Analysis* (SICA) and the *Mass Line*. These are the secret ingredients that form the recipe for a correct modern theory of our own community.

## Criticism and Self-Criticism

In bourgeois liberal society, we're taught that conflict is bad and to be avoided at all costs. We're also taught that criticism is a dirty word, and to criticise someone is synonymous with insulting and slandering them. As Communists, we take a different approach to conflict and criticism. Communists believe that conflict is good, because the resolution of a conflict always creates a new thing that's stronger and improved. We also believe in holding ourselves accountable, to the public and to our comrades, so that others can learn from our mistakes. But there is a productive and healing way to go about this, and a destructive and hateful way to go about this. As Communists, we always seek to keep our critcism and self-criticism positive, constructive, and compassionate.

## Class Consciousness

A necessary ingredient for a revolutionary movement is a working class that is aware of it's own position. If nobody is aware that they are exploited, then they surely will never be persuaded to rise up. Similarly, if a class is not aware of who it's enemies and who it's friends are, then how can it possibly know who it's fighting against? How can it know who its allies are? That's what we seek to discuss here.

# The Four Horsemen of Fascism

By looking into the prison system, we can see which social classes are the most oppressed and thus have the most revolutionary potential. An analysis of this reveals that 92% of all prisoners are either queer, Black, Indigenous or disabled. Therefore, by looking at the particular chauvinisms that oppress these social classes, we gain a more thorough analysis of how capitalism works in the United States. We call these oppressions the "Four Horsemen" because they are the four harbingers of fascism, and represent the foundational pillars which uphold capitalist social relations.

# Errors
As discussed in the [[bylaws]], the left in Kansas suffers from a number of theoretical deficiencies and errors in thinking. This explains why there is no meaningful, organized opposition to capital that can represent workers in the class struggle. In order to build such an organization, we must identify and promote correct ideas and refute incorrect ideas. That is the purpose of this module
## Opportunism
Opportunism is a specific form of the error of Revisionism. Opportunism therefore is a revision of the revolutionary character of Marxism, which seeks to sacrifice one or more foundational principles in exchange for perceived short-term gains. Supporters of opportunism cloak this in language of "compromise", "pragmatism" or "being realistic". Therefore, we seek to educate comrades about why we must never sacrifice our revolutionary principles, and why the opportunists who go that route always inevitably fail in their task of bringing about Communism.
- What Is To Be Done? - Lenin
## Eclecticism
Eclecticism is the error that occurs when one has a mish-mash ideology. Sometimes it is referred to as the "Big Tent" or "Left Unity". It stems from a postmodernist notion that there is no such thing as objective truth, that all ideas are equal, and that correctness is a function of popularity or consensus. At it's worst, eclecticism breeds fascism. In less extreme forms, eclecticism can paralyze an organization and lead it to run around in circles like a chicken with it's head cut off, unable to navigate in a straight direction.
- [[ur-fascism|Ur-Fascism]] - Eco
- Materialism and Empiriocriticism - Lenin
## Tailism
Tailism occurs when a movement drags behind and rides the metaphorical "coat tails" of the masses. At it's worst, this can mean giving into outright chauvinism such as transphobia to win over reactionary workers. Or in a less extreme form, it can look like when Communists refuse to push an advance line due to a variety of liberal misconceptions.
