# Communications Protocol
Version 1.0

## Purpose
This protocol establishes secure and effective communications procedures for activist organizations while maintaining operational security and ensuring clear information flow during both regular operations and emergencies.

## General Communications Principles

### Security First
Communications security forms the foundation of all our protocols. All members must:
- Operate under the assumption that communications may be monitored
- Share information on a need-to-know basis
- Use appropriate security tools and practices
- Never share sensitive details over unsecured channels
- Regularly update security practices based on current threats

### Clear Communication Standards
All communications should be:
- Brief but complete
- Clear and unambiguous
- Confirmed when received
- Documented when necessary
- Professional in tone
- Free of jargon unless specifically required
