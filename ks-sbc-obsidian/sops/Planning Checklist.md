# Standard Operating Procedure for Protest/Demonstration Planning

To be used as a template not just by us, but to be shared and circulated so that best practices take root within the movement.
## Principles

As a revolutionary organization, we maintain certain principles. We encourage and allow debate and diverse ideas, but there are certain things we do not compromise upon. By being involved in this planning, you agree to the following principles as a condition of involvement:
* No collaborating with police, no coordinating with the government, and we don't ask for permission or permits.
* We do not encourage anyone to do adventurism or any kind of political violence!!
* We also don't call for peacefulness, understanding, or civility. We also don't police other peoples political speech or actions.
	* Dealing with disruptions, hecklers, reactionaries, etc is not counted as policing others speech. We do not tolerate chauvinism at our events.
* We explicitly acknowledge that capitalism is the problem, and nothing short of a communist revolution is the solution.
* Intensifying contradictions, divides, and schisms between social classes is a good thing and desirable outcome.

We are all here as comrades. We all have our own views and opinions, however we should approach this from a position of mutual respect and assume good intentions. Do not accuse people of being cops without ample evidence!

We practice Democratic Centralism, which means that we democratically deliberate, debate, and decide upon a course of action. But once that decision has been made democratically, we stick to the decision even if we personally disagree with it.

Remember: One Team, One Fight!

Each concrete task needs someone to take ownership of the task to accomplish it. Make sure to utilize backwards planning for time.
