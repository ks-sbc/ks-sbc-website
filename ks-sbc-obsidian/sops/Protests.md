# Standard Operating Procedure for Protest/Demonstration Planning
Version 1.0

## Purpose
This SOP establishes standard procedures and guidelines for planning, organizing, and executing mass protests and demonstrations. It provides a framework to ensure consistent, safe, and effective execution of protest events while maintaining operational security and promoting positive community engagement.

## Scope
This document applies to all members involved in protest planning and execution. It covers pre-event planning, day-of operations, and post-event activities.

## Principles and Core Values
Our organization maintains certain foundational principles that guide all our activities:

1. Political Violence and Illegality
   - We do not participate or encourage adventuristic behaviors
   - We refuse to condemn or denounce such methods, even though we personally will not engage in them
   - We adhere to these principles not out of pacifism or cowardice or a desire to obey the law, but because at this time they are politically disadvantageous to revolutionary organizing

2. Democratic Process
   - We practice democratic centralism in decision-making
   - All major decisions require group consensus.
   - Minor decisions of details may be delegated to individuals or committees
   - Once decisions are made, we maintain unity in action.
   - We assume that everyone involved in planning is a comrade, and that they come from a position of good faith even if we disagree.
   - We do not spuriously accuse comrades of being police officers.
   - If one has a serious concern that someone is law enforcement, then it is on the accuser to bring forth concrete and objective evidence proving their claim.

3. Community Accountability
   - We do not police other peoples political speech or actions.
   * Dealing with disruptions, hecklers, and reactionaries is not considered to be policing speech.
   * We do not tolerate chauvinism at our events. IE racism, sexism, transphobia, etc.
   - We maintain transparency with our base and with ourselves.
   - We actively seek and incorporate community feedback.

4. Security Culture
   - We protect sensitive information.
   - We verify information before acting.
   - We assume every protest is being monitored by law enforcement as a matter of practice.
   - We operate under the principle that ***the support of the masses is the most effective form of safety.***
   - We do not leave any of our people behind. We do not abandon our fallen comrades.
   - If in doubt, disclose something to the organizing group as a collective. Transparency is safety.

5. Government and Law Enforcement
   * Whether or not we seek permits for our demonstration depends on a variety of operational environment factors and social context of the predicted attendance.
   * Under no circumstances do we establish liaisons or any kind of open communication with the police.
   * All law enforcement is to be treated as if they are an enemy occupying army.

6. Political Principles.
  * We explicitly acknowledge that capitalism is the problem
  * We always argue that nothing short of a communist revolution is the solution.
  * Intensifying contradictions, divides, and schisms between social classes is a good thing and desirable outcome.
  * Intensifying contradictions among the people is to be avoided
  * We maintain control of the messaging when it is our event that we are planning.
  * We do not tailor our message or water down our politics to appeal to other groups.

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment (D-30)
1. Political Analysis
   - Define clear political objectives
   - Define a specific operational goal
   - Identify the target audience
   - Assess political climate and timing
   - Evaluate potential allies and opponents

2. Risk Assessment
   - Conduct threat analysis
	   - Brainstorm possible threats
	   - Identify a probability of the threat becoming an issue (IE Highly likely, somewhat likely, not likely)
	   - For each threat identified, brainstorm the worst case scenario of what could go wrong
	   - For each threat identified, brainstorm the most likely scenario of what could go wrong
	   - Assign a color ranking (Green=low threat, yellow=medium threat, red=high threat, black=existential theat) to each threat based on the nature of the thread, the probability of the threat occurring, the severity and probability of the worst case scenario, and the severity and probability of the most likely scenario
   - Evaluate location security
	   - Routes of ingress and egress
	   - Note potential observation posts that can be used by the enemy for surveillance
	   - Analyze the location for its accessibility
	   - Factor in risks from the threat analysis into your evaluation of location
	   - Have a fallback location or alternative site plan
   - Assess weather impacts
	   - What is the likelihood of inclement weather?
	   - Does this weather pose a genuine danger, or merely an inconvenience?
	   - How is the weather likely to affect attendance?
	   - Can we do anything to mitigate risks created by the weather? IE providing cold water in the heat.
   - Review legal considerations
	   - Is there a likelihood of arrest?
	   - What is the general demeanor of the police? Aggressive or more relaxed?
	   - Discuss and plan for dealing with arrests in the event they're a realistic consequence.
		   - Medications.
		   - Full legal names.
		   - Emergency contacts.
		   - Point person for bail duty.
		   - Each organizer needs to honestly share their Red/Yellow/Green rating for how comfortable they are with arrests. 
	   - Does a permit make sense? Does it interfere with our political messaging?
