# Risk Assessment Matrix Template
Version 1.0

## Purpose
This risk assessment matrix helps organizers systematically evaluate and prepare for potential threats during protest actions. The matrix format allows for clear documentation and sharing of risk analysis across organizing teams.

## Instructions
1. List each identified threat in the first column
2. Rate probability on a scale of 1-5 (1=Very Unlikely, 5=Very Likely)
3. Describe worst-case and most likely scenarios in detail
4. Add mitigation strategies for each scenario
5. Update this document as new information becomes available

## Probability Scale Reference
1. Very Unlikely - Has not happened in our region, would be surprising
2. Unlikely - Has happened but rarely, not expected
3. Possible - Has happened occasionally, could reasonably occur
4. Likely - Happens regularly, should be expected
5. Very Likely - Almost certain to occur, plan accordingly

## Additional Documentation

### Notes on Each Category:

1. Threat Identification
   - Be specific about the nature of the threat
   - Include both external and internal threats
   - Consider timing-specific threats
   - Document any historical precedent

2. Probability Assessment
   - Base ratings on historical events
   - Consider current conditions
   - Factor in location-specific issues
   - Account for timing and season

3. Worst Case Scenario
   - Describe the most severe realistic outcome
   - Include potential cascading effects
   - Consider impact on broader movement
   - Document potential long-term consequences

4. Most Likely Scenario
   - Base on previous experiences
   - Consider current context
   - Include immediate impacts
   - Describe typical resolution

5. Mitigation Strategies
   - Must be specific and actionable
   - Assign responsibility for each action
   - Include resource requirements
   - Set clear timeline for implementation

## Regular Review Protocol
1. Review full matrix before each action
2. Update probability ratings based on current conditions
3. Revise mitigation strategies based on new information
4. Document any new threats identified
5. Share updates with all relevant teams

## Resource Requirements Tracking

For each mitigation strategy, document:
- Personnel needed
- Equipment required
- Training requirements
- Budget implications
- Timeline for implementation

## Post-Event Analysis

After each action, document:
1. Which threats materialized
2. Effectiveness of mitigation strategies
3. New threats identified
4. Lessons learned
5. Recommended changes to matrix
