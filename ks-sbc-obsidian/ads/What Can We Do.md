# What Is To Be Done?
You're here because you saw one of our posters and it resonated with you. You know deep down inside there's something rotten about our political system. The Democrats gave us a shambling, alzheimers-riddled corpse resurrected by a necromancer as one candidate. But his vitality is so low and his mind so far gone, that the ruling class had no option to withdraw him. 

Now we're presumably stuck with Kamala "Top Cop" Harris, a neoliberal fascist prosecutor with a hard-on for [locking up parents because their kids don't attend school.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-truancy-arrests-2020-progressive-prosecutor_n_5c995789e4b0f7bfa1b57d2e)

On the other side, we have the New York billionaire and serial rapist Donald Trump, a trust fund baby who's crowning political accomplishments were [throwing migrant children into concentration camps](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/03/02/how-border-apprehensions-ice-arrests-and-deportations-have-changed-under-trump/).

These two disgusting fascists are who we're supposed to be excited about! If you deviate ever so slightly from accepting the phony illusion of choice, liberal Democrats will scream at you about how "this is the most important election" and how we ***have*** to vote Democrat because of "harm reduction" or some such bullshit.

We're supposed to just sit down and accept the fact that this is just how democracy works, that we gotta vote for one or the other and wait another 4 years to get a better person in office. Or so we're told.

But what if we told you that things don't have to be this way? What if we told you there **is** a solution that doesn't involve picking between America's Top Jailer and a Billionaire Sex Criminal?

That's why we're hosting this meeting on ***Friday, July 26th at 7:30pm in City Park, Manhattan***! Come join your friends in the *Flint Hills Marxist Study Group* for a live discussion of the article [Dump Nixon! Stop the Fascist Tide!](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-2/ol-nixon-fascism.htm) which looks to an earlier period of US history where there was a similar crisis among the ruling class. Come learn with us in community as we read this document together and have a group discussion about the parallels between the past and the present. And, most importantly, talk about what we can do about this situation.

If you can't, that's quite okay. Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/39KYt7ZgK)A to attend remotely as well as get involved in other discussions and learn more about other events!  
# Discussion Questions
As you read [the article](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-2/ol-nixon-fascism.htm) keep these questions in mind. They shall form the basis of our discussion!

1. What similarities do you notice between Richard Nixon and Joseph Biden?

2. What common themes do you notice between the political climate in the article, and todays political climate?

3. What about today's labor movement? Where does the leadership of our unions stand? What about the rank and file?

4. What is a reactionary?

5. What is an opportunist?

6. What does it actually look like to mobilize people directly? How is that different from politics as usual?

7. Why is the Constitution of the United States always treated with such great respect by politicians of both parties? Do you think it's a good document? Is it worth preserving?

8. What are some alternatives to electoral participation? Why is there always such a strong push to funnel us into that when it has a track record of not accomplishing anything?

9. Do you think a revolution is possible in the United States? What might that look like? What's holding people back?

10. What is consent in terms of class dynamics? What are some of the ways that consent is manufactured? Are all forms of coercion violent?
