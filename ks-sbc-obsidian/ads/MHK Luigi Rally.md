## Details
- Location: Triangle Park, MHK
- Time: 1pm - 3pm![[Screenshot_2025-01-17-18-38-33-14.jpg]]
- Date: February 8

## Purpose
Luigi's indictment date is February 21, 2024 for the crimes he has ***allegedly*** committed. We dispute that any such crime occured, and that Luigi is an innocent man who took no human lives!

Therefore, to show community support, we want to rally Manhattan residents of all backgrounds to unite and show both Luigi himself, as well as the world, that the Little Apple stands in solidarity with the Big Apple!

Come join us as we not only express our support for Luigi, but also hear from community members about their own struggles with health care. Do you want to share your story. Get in touch with us at ks-sbc@protonmail.com to discuss if you want to share your own experiences either in person, or if you want us to read about it at the event.

We also think it's important to tie this whole alleged crime back into the broader picture of Capitalism. So we will be hosting some speeches as well, to clarify about how not only is it out health care system but our entire capitalist economy, that is the problem. And most importantly, we want to find solutions that work. Neither the ballot box nor the ***alleged*** lone wolf assassins bullet has solved the health care system. So what will work? Attend this event and let's find out together.
